//Declaring Arrays
Array variables are declared identically to variables of their data type, except that the variable name is followed by one pair of 
square [ ] brackets for each dimension of the array.
Uninitialized arrays must have the dimensions of their rows, columns, etc. listed within the square brackets.
Dimensions used when declaring arrays in C must be positive integral constants or constant expressions

//Initializing Arrays
Arrays may be initialized when they are declared, just as any other variables.
An array may be partially initialized, by providing fewer data items than the size of the array.The remaining array elements will be
automatically initialized to zero
If an array is to be completely initialized, the dimension of the array is not required.  The compiler will automatically size 
the array to fit the initialized data

// Fibonaccai program using array
#include<stdio.h>
 int main()
{
int i,range;
long int arr[40];
printf("enter the number");
scanf("%d",&range);

arr[0]=0;
arr[1]=1;

for(i=2;i<range;i++){
arr[i] = arr[i-1] + arr[i-2];
}

printf("Fibonacci series is:");
for(i=0;i<range;i++)
printf("%ld",arr[i]);
printf("\nFibonacci Ends \n\n");

return 0;
}
